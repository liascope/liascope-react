 Liascope Astrology ‑React 🌟

A modern astrology chart viewer built with React.js and Next.js—showing a significant evolution from my earlier vanilla‑JS MVC-based Liascope project. This application demonstrates a solid understanding of frontend development, state management, data fetching, animations, form handling, and interactive UI design.

🚀 Key Features

Multi-chart generation
  Generate and view six distinct charts:

  * Natal
  * Transit or Partner Natal
  * Natal & Transit or Synastry
  * Draconic
  * Progression
  * Annual Perfection

Comparison mode selection  
Flexible form-based selection between:

* Natal & Transit comparison
* Synastry chart mode

Copy chart feature  
* Copy structured chart data for external use (e.g. AI analysis or sharing)

Save & Load

  * Store up to 5 charts locally via `localStorage`.
  * Session persistence: Calculated charts remain available after a page refresh using `sessionStorage`.

Aspect and filter tools

  * Interactive aspect table
  * Planet & house position lists
  * Flexible filtering of chart aspects

Transit tools

  * Auto-complete of “today’s transits”
  * Select dates easily for transit charts

  Reactivity & animations
  Smooth transitions powered by Framer Motion, and responsive UI behaviors.

🧩 Tech Stack

* Next.js + React.js – fullstack React framework
* Context API – global state management
* React Query – efficient data fetching with reusable custom hooks
* React Hook Form – performant form handling and validation
*  Custom Loader, Error & Loading Pages – implemented using Next.js conventions
*  Modal Window – provides additional information in a focused view
* Custom SVG Icons – handcrafted UI elements
* Framer Motion – UI animations and transitions
* Tailwind CSS – utility-first styling
* SVG – custom icons, handcrafted for the UI
* Astrology libraries – @astrodraw/astrochart, js_astro (extended for custom logic)
* APIs – Timezone (timezonedb), Location (Nominatim)
* Utilities – Moment.js, Lodash, Cookies-next
* Tooling – ESLint, Prettier, React Query Devtools

 🧠 What I’ve Learned & Demonstrated

* Cleanly refactored from vanilla‑JS MVC to a robust React/Next.js architecture
* Implemented persistent chart storage with localStorage and sessionStorage to maintain state across sessions and page refreshes
* Built multiple custom React Query hooks, managing loading and error states effectively
* Mastered form state management with React Hook Form
* Utilized animations and transitions for better user experience
* Integrated complex third-party APIs (timezone, nominatim)
* Rendered astrology charts with precise planetary and cusp calculations
* Styled a responsive, filterable UI with Tailwind CSS
* Applied Next.js App Router conventions including custom error and loading pages
*  Built a custom loader component and implemented a modal window for additional info
*  Created custom SVG icons for interactive UI elements
* Worked with APIs and third-party libraries:
   - Integrated an SVG horoscope rendering library and extended it with DOM manipulation to highlight retrograde planets in red
   - Adapted a planetary calculation library written in a foreign codebase, first understanding its internal logic and then tailoring it to fit seamlessly into my application


🔧 Running the Project
